# 📚 CourseCentralQU – Webapp

The webapp code for CourseCentralQU, a course insights platform built for Queen's University students. This repository powers the data collection layer for a system that:

- Displays **historic grade distribution data** for courses.
- Hosts a **RAG-powered chatbot** trained on real student feedback from Reddit and RateMyProfessors.

The chatbot enables Queen’s students to get honest, up-to-date insights on courses and instructors — beyond just what's in the calendar.
